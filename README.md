# rsd_decoder

Very simple and poorly written program that will extract data from a Garmin .rsd file to a .csv which can be used in things like ArcGIS, Google Earth, GRASS, etc....

I am not sure how well the program will handle files with extensions, so I rename the .rsd file to drop the extension before running it through the program.

THE PROGRAM IS VERY SLOW, so please, give it time. It will eventually spit out a file called test.csv

Most of the credit goes to Herbert Oppmann who has figured out the file structure. I just created a crappy program to do the grunt work.
